Comparing MLB Stats Across Decades


Purpose ---
To compare MLB pitching and batting stats across decades, covering 1870 - 2019 with the decade spanning 0 - 9 (1870-1879)


Adjustments ---
Some of the data pre-1900 was missing so I had to either leave stuff out or calculate averages and extrapolate.

To complete the decades for 1870s and 2010s, I had to create a dummy set of stats for 1870, 2019, and half of 2018. I did this using average calulations of the next 3 years for 1870, and the last 3 years for 2018, 2019


Clarifications ---
To create the "Free Passes Per 9 Innings Pitched" metric, I added the walks, hits-by-pitch(HBP), balks, and wild pitches. For that graph I had to leave off the 1870s and 1880s because there was no HBP data for 1870s and for part of the 1880s as well as seemingly incomplete balks data.

Note: I used the "Total" table instead of the "Averages" table to calculate my own averages and adjust some things.
